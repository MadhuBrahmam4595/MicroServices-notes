âœ… Key Microservices Concepts You Must Learn
Hereâ€™s a structured list that will help you level up:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Core Microservices Concepts
What are Microservices? Benefits over Monoliths

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Bounded Context

Service Registry & Discovery (Eureka, Consul)

Inter-Service Communication:

REST API

Feign Client

gRPC (optional for advanced roles)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Spring Cloud Ecosystem
Spring Cloud Netflix (Eureka, Zuul/Gateway, Ribbon â€“ optional)

Spring Cloud Gateway (modern replacement for Zuul)

Spring Cloud Config â€“ centralized configuration

Feign Client â€“ declarative REST client

Circuit Breaker â€“ Resilience4j (new) or Hystrix (legacy)

Load Balancing â€“ Ribbon (deprecated), Spring Cloud LoadBalancer

ðŸ”¹ 3. Resilience and Fault Tolerance
Resilience4j: Retry, RateLimiter, CircuitBreaker

Timeout and fallback mechanisms

ðŸ”¹ 4. Service Communication Patterns
Synchronous vs Asynchronous communication

Event-driven architecture using:

Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ

Publish/Subscribe vs Point-to-Point

ðŸ”¹ 5. Security in Microservices
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) based authentication

OAuth2 / OpenID Connect

API Gateway + Authorization

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

ðŸ”¹ 6. Observability & Monitoring
Centralized Logging with ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or EFK

Distributed Tracing: Sleuth, Zipkin, Jaeger

Metrics & Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana

ðŸ”¹ 7. Database Patterns in Microservices
Database per service

Saga Pattern (Orchestration vs Choreography)

Eventual consistency

ðŸ”¹ 8. Deployment & DevOps Basics
Docker (containerize each microservice)

Kubernetes (basic understanding for orchestration)

CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)

Helm (for K8s deployments)

ðŸ”¹ 9. API Design Best Practices
RESTful API design principles

Versioning

Pagination, filtering, sorting

Swagger / OpenAPI for documentation
